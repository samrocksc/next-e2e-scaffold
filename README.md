This is a simple UI kit for setting up a next package with e2e and Jest testing

## Reason I made This

I wanted a place to make sure that I was keeping my UI/UX skills up to date. For that reason I have the following questions prepared:

1. Question: How would you create a new page in this Next.js application called _fruits_ and navigate to it from the home page?
2. How would you filter the data array to only show items with
   a price greater than $1.00
3. How would you sort the items in the data array by price in ascending order?
4. How would you add a new item to the data array?
5. Filter the array in a way that it does not receive any results
   and render a "No Results" component
